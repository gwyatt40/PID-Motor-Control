//Georgia and Basir
// Prototype Code 2 (Zero Cross + DimValue Code)
/* We found this code online early on in the code trial process. It compares a "dimValue" variable read and converted 
from a potentiometer with a with a "dimming" variable to determine whether the brightness should increase or decrease.
There is a seperate void function involving the zero cross detector and triac control. This code did not work, but 
that may have been due to an error with our dimmer and not due to any faults in the code itself. The comments are from the
the website.*/
