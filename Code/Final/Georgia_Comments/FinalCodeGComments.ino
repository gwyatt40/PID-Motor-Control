//Georgia and Basir
// Final Motor Control Code (Georgia's Comments)
/* This was the first code we tried after ordering a new dimmer and it worked. With a few changes, it became our final 
code. The one hiccup we encountered with this code was that it is impossible to run delays in it because the code
already uses the Arduino's timer functions. The comments on this version are mine, to see comments from the website go
to the "original comment" file. */
