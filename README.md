# PID-Motor-Control-
## Project Goal
  To design a method to successfully and accurately control a blender motor through an Arduino AC dimmer that will allow for the addition of PID code to minimize error. Due date: Dec 13, 2019
## Success Criteria
- The end goal for the entire project is to have a motor that maintains a constant speed no matter the level of reistance. This goal will be accomplished by combining our motor-AC dimmer complex with Justine and Ella's photoreflector sensor which will calculate the speed. 

- For our section of the project, our measures of success are: 
1. Being able to accurately control the speed of a motor using the AC dimmer
2. The AC dimmer ardcomplex to be efficently attached to the rest of the blender 

## Project Schedule 
 ### Individual Goals: 
 Georgia: Finish notebook, complete plan, 
 Basir: Finish notebook, create mock assembly, design fritzing, work on plan
 ### Weekly Goals:
Nov 26-Dec 1:
  Georgia- Finish basic outline of the plan and schedule. Research and come back from break with several ideas for setup. Finish notebook. 
  Basir- Finish notebook
Dec 1- Dec 6: 
  Georgia- Finish plan specifics. Decide on specific methods for setup, power, etc. Make materials list. Write criteria and constraints.
  Basir- Finish fritzng by Friday, work on mock assembly?
Dec 8- Dec 13:
  Georgia- Gather and plan materials, use list from plan. Begin setup. 
  Basir- Finish and check Solidworks mock assembly
